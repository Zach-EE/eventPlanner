# eventPlanner
This application is a daily planner that shows users a time in hour blocks and allows for events to be saved by user. When an event is saved it will be saved to localStorage to prevent refreshing from causing saved events to be lost.

To-Add-Event: Type event description into the text-block and press the save button. A notification of success will notify user upon success. Example PNG found in "./img" directory.
